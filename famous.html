          <h3>Pele</h3>
          <p>
            Considered one of the greatest players of all time, Pele's influence
            on the game is immeasurable. He won three World Cups with Brazil
            (1958, 1962, and 1970), a record that still stands today. His

            the field, inspiring generations of footballers worldwide. Pele's
            legacy extends beyond his playing days. As an ambassador for the
            sport and a global icon, he helped popularize football in countries
