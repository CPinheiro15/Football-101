        <h2>Game Rules</h2>
        <p>
          Understanding the basics of football rules is essential for anyone
          looking to enjoy the game. Here, we cover the fundamental rules of
          football.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="rule">
        <h3>1. The Objective</h3>
        <p>
          The main objective of football is to score more goals than the
          opposing team. Each team tries to send the ball into the opposing
          teamâ€™s goal while preventing the opposing team from doing the same.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="rule">
        <h3>2. The Field</h3>
        <p>
          Football is played on a rectangular field with goals at each end. The
          field size varies, but it generally ranges from 100 to 130 yards in
          length and 50 to 100 yards in width.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="rule">
        <h3>3. Duration of the Game</h3>
        <p>
          A standard football match lasts 90 minutes, split into two 45-minute
          halves. If necessary, additional time may be added for stoppages.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="rule">
        <h3>4. Players and Positions</h3>
        <p>
          Each team consists of 11 players: a goalkeeper, defenders,
          midfielders, and forwards. Each position has specific roles, but all
          players can move freely on the field.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="rule">
        <h3>5. Scoring a Goal</h3>
        <p>
          A goal is scored when the entire ball crosses the goal line between
          the goalposts. The team with the most goals at the end of the match
          wins.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="rule">
        <h3>6. Fouls and Penalties</h3>
        <p>
          Players must avoid fouls, such as tripping or pushing opponents.
          Severe fouls may lead to free kicks, penalty kicks, or even yellow or
          red cards.
